## storage

The aim here is to have a module in Clucker that will serve as a way to save game states for projects that I build on top of this game framework. This is yet another must have feature that I will likley want to use in most of not all projects made with clucker, so yet again I am going ahead and making this a part of what the core of Clucker is
