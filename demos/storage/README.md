# storage demo

As of Clucker 0.7.0 I now have a storage module that thus far makes use of localStoarge only, but might it time also support other options for saving a game state if I put more time into this specifc module of Clucker. Anyway whenever I add I new major feature to Clucker I often make at least one demo that is a way to just test out that the feature of Clucker is working as it should and this is such a demo this time with the storage module of Clucker.
