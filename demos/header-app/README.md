# header-app

This is my first header-app demo, to which I think I will want to make at least a few of. One of these might be a simple clucker demo that I will embed into the header of my website, or at least that is the idea with this collection of demos. For now the general idea is to start out with something bery basic to start out with that will serve as a nice clean starting point for this sort of thing when it comes to making additional projects based off of this.


* get the logo layer worked out
* have a pause button for this that when clicked will case the game to stop
* make sure that sm.fps is adjusted to be real low when paused, and set higher when not
