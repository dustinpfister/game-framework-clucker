# header-app

This is my first header-app demo, to which I think I will want to make at least a few of. One of these might be a simple clucker demo that I will embed into the header of my website, or at least that is the idea with this collection of demos. For now the general idea is to start out with something bery basic to start out with that will serve as a nice clean starting point for this sort of thing when it comes to making additional projects based off of this.

The features that should be working for this basic header-app:

* have an article module that can be used to create stats based on page content
* use article stats to set certian values of the header-app such as the number of ships
* have a logo layer that will be like the background layer, only it will be a logo overlay for the site
* have a pause button for this that when clicked will case the game to stop
* make sure that sm.fps is adjusted to be real low when paused, and set higher when not
* I will want to use images for this, have a /img/ships/ folder for the first set of images
* have an background image for image 0.png
* have an overlay image for 1.png
* images 3.png forward will then change depeding on the header-app demo for this one it will be sprites for the ships

* have buttons images for 2.png
* make sure to use an image to skin the pause button
