<p>
This is a demo of a header-app that I might put in the header of my website, or at least it is a start when it comes to this kind of project. There are a number of things that I would like to make sure are working well before going ahead with deploying this to my website, but even if I do it will most likely not be this demo, but a demo that is based off of this.
</p>

<h2 class="headerlink">Acticle element text content feature</h2>
<p>
One of the main features that I would like to have in this kind of applaction is to have a little javaScript code that will take a look at how many atricle elements there are in a page, and use the text content of those article elements to inpact the state of the game or simulation that is going on in the header app.
</p>

<h2 class="headerlink">Started a draft folder for this demo</h2>

For this header-app demo I started a draft folder to work out soem basic idaes that I would like to maybe include in this demo, without creating addtional demos in the root demo folder, or breaking what I have thus far with buggy code.

<h3 class="headerlink">The get angle to target demo</h3>
<p>
I made an additional demo for this project that is a <a href="/demos/header-app/draft/get-shoot-at-angle.html">get shoot at angle demo</a>, that is a bit more than just simply using the Math.atan2 method. The thing about this demo is to just make a system that involves shooting at where the target will be rather than where it is now. That is having a system that involves shoting shots at a target by way of a fixed static heading rather than some kind of homing in shot, that will of course would be a whole other ball of wax. The system that I have as of this writing seems to work okay but it would seem that this is a not so simple task. I might want to make some additional methods for this at some point if I do keep working on this, but I do not want this to end up being a rabit hole.
