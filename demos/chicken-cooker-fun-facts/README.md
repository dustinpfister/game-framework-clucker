# chicken-cooker-fun-facts

This is yet another chicken-cooker-\* demo based off of the souce code in chicken-cooker-sheets which in turn was based off of chicken-cooker. With this demo I wanted to start a system that has to do with a charicter appearing at the bottom of the canvas to mention some kind of fun fact about chickens, or the game. The idea is to just have a fun feature that would be nice for some kind of kiosk like project, or a tutorial system. 

So for this I am going to need to work out a few custom systems when it comes to having a spriyte sheets to handle what I have in mind for animation. In additional I think I will also want to work out a quick system for using an image to work as a sprite sheet for a custom font for this collection of demos for the clucker framework.

## So the main focus is this fun fact system
