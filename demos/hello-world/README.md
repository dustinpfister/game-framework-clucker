# hello-world demo

This is the first demo that I made for this framework, and as one would exspect the only mail featre is to just simmply display the text 'Hello World' in one of the canvas layers. There is however just a bit more going on beyond just that, but the main idea here is to just have a very simple starting point example for a Clucker app.
