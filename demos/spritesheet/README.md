# spritesheet demo

The aim of this demo is to test out and also see what needs to improve when it comes to using sprite sheets in clucker. There is likely going to need to be more than one system for creating a sprite sheet objects array of cell info objects. The typical situation though would be that each image just follows a grid like pattern so I have a built in method for that. However I still have a system that involves an array of objects where each object is an x, y, w, and h value fro each cell in the source image, that if used right should work with any kind of sprite sheet.

There is however not just the question of how I go about formating my sprite sheets, there is also the question of how to go about setting a cell index value for a cell in one or more sprite sheets. This is where things can get a little confusing, and there can often end up being more than one system involve depending on the nature of the game that I am working on. For example things are pretty easy to understand when dealing with a pool of display objects where each display object is just this one four cell animation in one sheet. However what if I have a pool of display objects where each object is a type of ship, and each type of ship can move in 8 directions and at two different speeds? In this demo I am aiming to work out some of the simple, and not so simple problems that I will be running into with this sort of thing.
