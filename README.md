# game-framework-clucker

This is a basic game framework based off of what I have made for my [blog post on the topic of a basic game framework](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2021/09/03/js-javascript-example-game-framework/) which is just one of my many javascript examples series of posts. The example started to get at least a little complex to the point that writing a single blog post on the souce code would result in a blog post that is way to long. So I thought it would be a good idea to copy the source code for the framework, and then demos thus far into a stand alone reposatory and contineu working on it there.


## Core Features of this game framework

I would like to keep this framework fairly basic and striped down to just a core set of features that I am actually going to use in one or more games that will be built on top of this foundation.

* A state machine
* A canvas library that supports: layers, built in points collection system, built in draw methods, a plugin system
* An object pool librray for creating a collection of display objects aka sprites
* A general utility librray with various methods used for bounding box, distance, ect
